# Personal Music Streamer

This goal of this project is to be able to select and stream MP3 and FLAC files
from a personal music collection through a website. This project is an
opportunity to explore the following:

-__Test Driven Development__ - Use [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) to build unit
tests and guide development.
-__MySQL__ - Use a MySQL database to simplify and standardize the display of
songs and the creation of playlists.
-__HTML5__ - Use an HTML5 music player on the page.
